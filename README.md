# ES6 + Nodejs starter kit
original project can be found [here](https://github.com/vmasto/express-babel). Read that for more info :)

This repo is a shameless ripoff of vmasto's express-babel. The only difference is that this boiler plate uses [ejs](http://ejs.co/) instead of [pug](http://ejs.co/)

## To run
`npm run dev`
